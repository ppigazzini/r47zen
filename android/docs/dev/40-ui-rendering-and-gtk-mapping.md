# UI Rendering And GTK Mapping

## Logical shell model

The Android shell now renders against one logical calculator body canvas,
not against device pixels:

- the live logical canvas is the measured reference frame `1820 x 3403`
- `r47_texture.webp` and `r47_background.webp` share the same measured shipped
  size in every density bucket: mdpi `360 x 673`, hdpi `540 x 1010`, xhdpi
  `720 x 1346`, xxhdpi `1080 x 2019`, xxxhdpi `1440 x 2692`
- all shell chrome, LCD placement, keypad children, and touch zones resolve
  from the same logical-canvas coordinates before projection into the current
  window

In `full_width`, `ReplicaOverlay` now fits one shared visible frame across all
three modes. The visible-frame trim is `42 / 49 / 42 / 56` logical-canvas units
for left, top, right, and bottom. `physical` uses the full logical shell and
caps the fit scale to the density-resolved shell bitmap width divided by
`R47ReferenceGeometry.LOGICAL_CANVAS_WIDTH`.

`ReplicaOverlay` projects the active shell into the current window. In normal
mode it either draws native shell chrome with `Canvas`, draws the restored
`r47_background` background shell image behind the scene-driven keypad labels
and softkey state text, or
draws the restored `r47_texture` classic image shell. `ReplicaKeypadLayout`
now owns one normalized shared touch-cell map across all chrome modes. The
grid uses contiguous row bands, shared midline boundaries, and consistent outer
keypad bounds inside each row group. `r47_texture` uses that map without
rendered key views, `native` keeps the full scene-driven key views, and
`r47_background` keeps the scene-driven labels and softkey state text without
Android-painted key surfaces on top of the same active-cell geometry.
`ReplicaOverlay` also keeps one shared settings-entry touch strip across all
chrome modes. All three modes now share one texture-derived LCD placement
contract, and `full_width` uses one shared visible-frame crop contract across
the texture, background-backed, and native shells. In PiP mode the overlay draws the LCD bitmap
full-window and maps horizontal touches across the LCD to the six softkeys.

The overlay exposes two scaling modes:

- `full_width`: fit the logical shell inside the trimmed window frame
- `physical`: cap the fit scale to the measured shared shell-image width for
  the resolved density bucket, divided by
  `R47ReferenceGeometry.LOGICAL_CANVAS_WIDTH`

The overlay exposes three shell chrome values:

- `r47_texture`: restore the classic full-image shell and use the shared
  invisible touch-cell map plus the same settings-entry touch strip as the
  other modes
- `r47_background`: draw the density-qualified background shell while
  keeping the scene-driven label and softkey-state overlay on the shared
  touch-cell map and the texture-aligned LCD frame
- `native`: draw the body, bezel, and LCD frame with Android `Canvas` while
  keeping the same logical keypad geometry, settings-entry touch strip, and
  texture-aligned LCD frame

The native software shell fills the rounded calculator body with
`RGB(32, 32, 32)`, drops the separate top and bottom bar pass, and keeps the
`80`-unit logical-canvas corner radius before projection. The view background
outside that rounded silhouette stays black.

The projection is the first place to inspect when the shell or LCD looks
correctly rendered but globally misplaced.

Projection errors usually affect the whole shell, the LCD frame, and the keypad
children together. A single-key issue is usually lower in the stack.

## LCD path

The native core exposes a `400 x 240` LCD pixel buffer. `NativeCoreRuntime`
pulls that buffer on the frame callback and hands it to `ReplicaOverlay`.

`ReplicaOverlay.updateLcd(...)`:

- compares the new frame against the cached pixel buffer
- computes the smallest changed rectangle
- updates the backing `Bitmap`
- invalidates only the changed on-screen region

That partial invalidation path is why LCD refresh bugs and keypad-layout bugs
must be debugged separately.

## Refresh path

`NativeCoreRuntime` pulls LCD pixels every frame while the app is active. It
also checks keypad metadata on the same frame loop and rebuilds the Kotlin
snapshot when native keypad state changes or when the fallback refresh interval
expires.

That means LCD bugs, keypad-state bugs, and rendering bugs can share the same
frame boundary while still having different owners.

## Keypad conversion model

The rendered keypad path is scene-driven. Android does not poll per-label text
from separate bridge calls. `r47_texture` still keeps invisible image-backed
touch zones, but those zones now come from the same normalized touch-cell map
used by the rendered shells.

The native side provides two arrays:

- keypad metadata
- keypad labels

`KeypadSnapshot.fromNative(...)` converts those arrays into:

- keyboard-wide state such as shift, alpha, and softmenu status
- one `KeypadKeySnapshot` per key
- style roles, layout classes, scene flags, overlay state, and show-value
  fields used by the Android renderer

The snapshot also preserves softmenu paging state, dotted-row state, function
preview state, and per-key enabled state. Android should consume those fields,
not recreate them from label text.

`LAYOUT_CLASS_ALPHA` is also part of that contract. The native export now uses
the same broader alphabetic-key gate as the upstream simulator's
`keyboard.c::determineItem()` path, so AIM, XEQ/PROG, catalog, and related
alphabetic states export `primaryAim` across the whole keypad. When native
exports an alpha-mode key, `CalculatorKeyView` suppresses the unused
fourth-label lane and lets the painted main-key body use the full slot width.
That keeps those alphabetic states on the scene-driven path instead of leaving
them confined to the normal faceplate spacer layout.

This keeps content and state on the native side while Android owns measurement,
projection, and drawing.

## Measured keypad geometry

`ReplicaKeypadLayout` places all 43 keys from `R47ReferenceGeometry` in the
same `1820 x 3403` logical canvas used by shell projection. `KeypadTopology`
owns the Android-local 43-key lane, family, and column map that the layout code
consumes for view construction and touch-row membership. The live constants are:

- standard left: `134`
- standard pitch: `272`
- standard key body width: `192`
- matrix first visible left: `465`
- matrix pitch: `331`
- matrix key body width: `228`
- enter width: `462`
- measured row height: `144`
- row step: `260`
- softkey row top: `1290`
- first small-row top: `1550`
- enter-row top: `2070`
- first large-row top: `2330`
- non-softkey view height: `236`

The row families resolve as:

```text
softkey_x(c) = 134 + 272 * c      where c = 0..5
softkey_y = 1290

small_row_x(c) = 134 + 272 * c    where c = 0..5
small_row_y(r) = 1550 + 260 * r   where r = 0..1

enter_key_x = 134
enter_key_y = 2070
enter_key_width = 462
enter_row_small_x(c) = 134 + 272 * c   where c = 2..5

large_row_left_x = 134
large_row_matrix_x(c) = 465 + 331 * c where c = 0..3
large_row_y(r) = 2330 + 260 * r        where r = 0..3
```

Rendered slot and body rules:

- softkeys use `192 x 144` outer slots and a `2`-unit draw inset on each side
- small-row standard keys use `272`-unit slots and `192`-unit button views
  inside a `236`-unit non-softkey view height
- key `13` uses the measured `462`-unit width and is not re-derived from a
  nominal two-column gap model
- visible matrix keys use `331`-unit slots and `228`-unit button views
- base-operator keys use `192`-unit slots with no fourth-label spacer

The touch-cell map follows the same measured geometry but does not reuse the
rendered key-view bounds. The upper keypad uses a `4 x 6` touch grid with the
enter key spanning two columns, the lower keypad uses a `4 x 5` grid, and all
touch-row bands have height `260`. Android still maps GTK font roles and label
semantics, but the live coordinates now come from the measured reference canvas
rather than from a copied GTK screen layout.

## Per-key renderer

Each key is a `CalculatorKeyView`. The view combines a painted key surface,
label views, and softkey-specific drawing logic.

Softkeys stay on a dedicated function-key renderer path because the native
scene contract carries reverse-video, overlay, preview, and value-state rules
that the main-key path does not.

It renders:

- primary label inside the painted key body
- F and G faceplate labels above the painted key body
- the fourth label from the right edge of the painted key body
- softkey text, auxiliary text, value text, preview accents, reverse-video
  states, strike marks, and overlay-state decorations when the scene contract
  asks for them

For alpha-mode main keys, the same view now applies the exported
`LAYOUT_CLASS_ALPHA` rule by dropping the unused fourth-label spacer and
centering the scene-driven alpha legends on the full key slot.

Main keys and softkeys share one view class, but the renderer separates the
layout slot from the painted body geometry.

Current native key-surface contract:

- default dark key fill is `RGB(64, 64, 64)`
- F accents use `RGB(242, 171, 94)` for faceplate labels, F-shift key fills,
  and the combined FG shift fill
- G accents use `RGB(131, 183, 223)` for faceplate labels and G-shift key
  fills
- those accent values come from the standard HSL lightness adjustment path:
  keep hue and saturation, then raise lightness by `10` points
- the Android touch path keeps no separate hover palette; F/G/FG styles use
  dedicated brighter pressed fills for touch feedback, while alpha keeps its
  base accent fill
- reverse-video states keep their state-specific fill colors
- main keys draw as plain rounded fills with no extra border, top bar, or
  bottom bar
- main-key corner radius is `20 * referenceBodyToViewWidthScale`
- softkey corner radius is `20 * softkeySurfaceScale`

Base text sizes before per-key scaling:

- primary label: `76` standard, `114` numeric, `94` shifted
- second and third labels: `64`
- fourth label: `66`

For main keys, the painted body rectangle is derived from the key's button view
and the shared optical width delta:

```text
referenceBodyToViewWidthScale = buttonView.width / designButtonWidth
inset = referenceBodyToViewWidthScale
half_width_bonus = (MAIN_KEY_BODY_OPTICAL_WIDTH_DELTA * referenceBodyToViewWidthScale) / 2

mainKeyRect.left = max(buttonView.left + inset - half_width_bonus, inset)
mainKeyRect.top = buttonView.top + inset
mainKeyRect.right = min(buttonView.right - inset + half_width_bonus,
                        view_width - inset)
mainKeyRect.bottom = buttonView.bottom - inset
```

That `mainKeyRect` then drives the label placement rules:

```text
button_center_x = mainKeyRect.centerX()
raw_button_center_x = buttonView.left + buttonView.width / 2
primary_translation_x = button_center_x - raw_button_center_x

gap = 10 * cell_scale
group_width = measured_f_width + gap + measured_g_width
group_left = mainKeyRect.centerX() - group_width / 2

f_top = -86 * cell_scale
g_top = -86 * cell_scale

letter_left = mainKeyRect.right + 16 * cell_scale
letter_top = 80 * cell_scale
```

The primary label is centered on the painted body, the `f` plus `g` pair is
centered as one group on that same body centerline, and the fourth label is
anchored from the painted body right edge rather than from the middle of the
spare lane. `CalculatorKeyView` applies the fixed `16`, `80`, and `86` values
from `KeyVisualPolicy`; it no longer recomputes fourth-label placement from
runtime glyph width or font-height compensation.

For softkeys, the slot is intentionally larger than the painted body:

```text
softkey_view_width = STANDARD_KEY_WIDTH
softkey_view_height = ROW_HEIGHT
softkey_rect = [2, 2, width - 2, height - 2]

painted_softkey_width = width - 4
painted_softkey_height = height - 4
```

Softkeys therefore use the measured `192 x 144` function-key slot while keeping
a dedicated interior drawing path for text, value fields, preview accents,
overlays, strike marks, and reverse-video states.

When auxiliary text is visible, the softkey primary legend anchors in the upper
band at `softkeyRect.top + 0.28 * softkeyRect.height()` instead of using the
lower centered baseline.

The Android settings theme reuses the same lifted F/G palette through
`colorPrimary = RGB(242, 171, 94)` and `colorSecondary = RGB(131, 183, 223)`.
It also keeps the upstream role split between `colorPrimary` and the blue
container or activated roles so the slider does not collapse to one color.

Typography and style come from scene data plus staged calculator fonts. Android
chooses how to measure and draw those roles; native code chooses which roles are
active.

For non-softkeys, inspect `CalculatorKeyView` first when label centering
diverges from the measured key body rather than from the full cell bounds.

## Softkey scene states

The softkey row can carry more than text:

- reverse video
- checkbox, radio-button, or memory-bank overlays
- `showText` and `showValue`
- function-preview targeting
- strike-out and strike-through states

The native snapshot also preserves top-line, bottom-line, menu, and dotted-row
flags. The current `CalculatorKeyView` softkey renderer does not draw those
four flags directly; audit the native scene contract and Android renderer
together before treating any of them as visible Android surfaces.

## Typography and label roles

`CalculatorKeyView` uses the staged calculator fonts and scene roles rather than
hardcoding one text style for all keys. In practice that means:

- primary labels can use different visual roles from faceplate labels
- main-key primary labels stay on the staged standard calculator font,
  including Alpha-styled captions such as the left-shift `Alpha` label
- numeric and softkey roles can diverge without changing geometry ownership
- faceplate labels that open menus are underlined because the native snapshot
  marks them as dedicated underline roles, not because Android inspects label
  text or moves the labels
- label-role changes should come from native scene metadata, not from ad hoc
  Android string inspection

Style-role changes do not by themselves justify a font-family change for main
key primary legends. If one primary legend appears in a different face from the
rest of the keypad, inspect the Android typeface selection and the native label
export path before treating it as a typography rule.

For the faceplate legends specifically, Android follows the upstream GTK rule:
an underlined F or G label means that legend opens a menu, while a non-
underlined F or G label is a direct function. The underline lives in the
styling path only, so Android does not own a separate underline vertical-gap
constant. Faceplate spacing, centering, and size rules stay shared.

## PiP interaction model

PiP mode is deliberately narrower than the normal shell. The overlay stops
drawing the full shell and maps horizontal touches across the LCD surface to the
six softkeys.

That is an interaction contract, not a reduced copy of the full keypad layout.

## Ownership of rendering decisions

When a visual rule is controlled by scene data, fix it in the native scene
contract. When it is controlled by Android-only projection or measurement, fix it
in the overlay, layout, or key renderer.

Use this split:

1. native scene data decides what a key means and which state is visible
2. `KeypadTopology` decides the Android-local row, family, and column contract
  for each key code
3. `ReplicaKeypadLayout` decides where the key lives in logical space
4. `ReplicaOverlay` decides how logical space maps into the current window
5. `CalculatorKeyView` decides how one key is measured and drawn

When a change touches more than one layer, prefer fixing the highest true owner
first.

## Practical debugging rules

When a visual mismatch appears, locate it in one of four places before editing:

1. native scene data
2. logical keypad geometry
3. overlay projection
4. per-key drawing behavior

Use that order because a per-key patch is often wrong when the actual defect is
in scene metadata or logical geometry.

Prefer fixing the owning contract instead of adding per-key exceptions.

As a rule:

- wrong text or wrong mode state means native snapshot first
- every key shifted together means layout or projection
- one key drawn wrong with correct content means `CalculatorKeyView`
